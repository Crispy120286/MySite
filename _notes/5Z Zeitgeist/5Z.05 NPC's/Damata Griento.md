## Damata Griento
A 40-something half-orc from Ber, Damata has brought his wife and two children on board for a vacation. Though the rest of his family is a boisterous party of new-wealth tourists eager to see the “Old World,” Damata is troubled and edging toward manic-depression. 

Damata hails from a family of orcish warchiefs in Ber, and he never fit in as a warrior, so he made his wealth in real estate, mostly dealing with Risuri and Danoran elites trying to set up factories. After a decade of success, though, he was suckered into a high-stakes con by a man posing as a Risuri train magnate, planning to build a railroad across the Anthras Mountains to connect the two countries. Damata was dazzled by a slick pitch that involved teleporting him to Flint and taking him to lavish parties. 

Seeing vast potential for wealth and needing a huge down payment to buy a stake, Damata took a loan from The Family, a criminal organization based out of Crisillyir. When his “partner” disappeared with tens of thousands of gold pieces, Damata was on the hook. After begging for mercy, he was told to steal his family’s magical heirlooms and war trophies and bring them to Nalaam, where local mages could convert the items into more liquid wealth. Damata botched an attempt to lie to his wife, and ended up with her and their kids tagging along, expecting to enjoy a vacation while Damata does “research for his railroad.” 

Damata has a suitcase of holding full of magic weapons and amulets he stole from his villa at home, about twenty items worth a total of 34,000 gp. He has a hunch he’ll never make it home alive, and even if he does, he’s pretty sure his family will kill him. 

Damata plans to show his family a great vacation—museums, lavish hotels, grand musical venues, fine dining—until they reach Nalaam. He has made arrangements with a business associate in Sid Minos to take in his family if anything untoward should befall him.
