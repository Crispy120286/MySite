## Session Summary
[[Galvan Emerick|Galvan]], [[Tevias Niktu|Tevias]], [[Alania Choirhall|Alania]], and [[Runar Halvorson|I]] all recieve letters requesting our presence at [[Heidmarch Manor]]. Once there we all meet eachother for the first time. [[Sheila Heidmarch]] and [[Koriah Azmeren]] ask us to open an ancient Thassalonian paradox box as a sort of interview for the Pathfinders. We manage to open it but are set upon by Gremlins from inside of it. 
Sheila and Koriah come back, They want us to find someone. One [[Natalia Vancaskerkin]]. She's a street informant for one the [[Sczarni Gangs]] and was about to uncover something that would be of interest to the Pathfinders. It pertained to Thassalon. Natalia recently just vanished and the Sczarni may be looking for her. We're allowed to keep the contents of the box and are sent out to find Natalia.
We go to Dockway and Galvan speaks to some of his informants. They direct us to [[The Amazing Zograthy]] and his twisted carnival. Zograthy says she hasnt been in touch with any of the Sczarni gangs and they're looking for her as well. Specifically [[the Tower Girls]]. We leave and look for information on the Tower Girls and that leads us to [[Fenster the Blight]] in Underbridge. Night begins falling and we're attacked by a Skeleton! 
We meet ol' Fenster and he tells us that Natalia has been seen around an alley near here and that she isnt a part of the Tower Girls anymore. She found something and decided she didnt want to be a member anymore.
We make our way to an old boarding house which has seen better days. Entering the building we encounter Goblins! After a bit of exploration we discover Natalia on the second story. She attacks us and we fight back, I knock her out. She drops a small metal object and I pick it up. I feel different.
