## History
Mayor: [[Doyle Idylls]]

The eastern outskirts of [[Flint]] are dominated by towering mountains, their peaks constantly shrouded in clouds that feed lush rainforests and verdant streams. The steep highlands are sparsely populated, but numerous plantations and small farms fill the flatter terrain near the coast. Few city folk venture out to these lands, believing that here the veil between the real world and [The Dreaming](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#The%20Dreaming) is thin. Local myths include countless tales of farmers, travelers, and juvenile miscreants who wander into the foggy woods and suffer wretched fates at the hands of capricious [fey](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Risuri%20Fey).

While most who live in Cloudwood consider it common courtesy to share a bowl of milk or plates of sliced fruit with unseen nightly visitors, the district’s new mayor, Doyle Idylls, has forbidden district employees from engaging in the old tradition. Mayor Idylls shares his office with the local police branch, and he recently had salt baked into bricks around its base in order to keep away curious fey. Soon thereafter, the building developed a gopher problem.

Though criminals in Flint tend to make the Nettles their first stop when on the run from the law, those who really need to lay low find the wild rainforests of Cloudwood ideal. The most rural areas of the district are practically independent thorps and hamlets, many of which are sympathetic to desperate outsiders. Until recently they reaped rewards from collaborating with at least three gangs which operated out of the forest, but a new player in the area has somehow managed to get the gangs to call off their attacks.

The Cloudwood is the hideout of the fey terrorist [[Gale]](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Hana%20Soliogn).

Legend has it that the Dreaming Cloudwood contains a Gema commune of Elfaivarans who fled the [Great Malice](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Great%20Malice), led by High Seer Lakshmi Saraswati and her consort Dhaval.
