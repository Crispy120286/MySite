**History**

The vast prairies of Ber were first inhabited by monstrous tribes, in incredible diversity; gnolls, goblins, orcs, minotaurs, other 'beastfolk.' Orcs, the most numerous, were merely a quarter.

Following the collapse of the [Demonocracy](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Demonocracy), the [Dragon Tyrants](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Dragon%20Tyrants) arrived in Ber en masse, violently conquering and establishing their own feuding polities and dragon-cults. City-states were built, razed and rebuilt in a seemingly endless cycle of violence. The people of Ber suffered greatly as they were forced to dig for gold and tame tyrant lizard dinosaurs for their draconic masters.

Jealous of [Risur](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Risur)'s riches, the Dragon Tyrants led many northern invasions. The monarchs of Risur retaliated with forays into Ber, culminating in King Boyle's defeat of the last Dragon Tyrants, Inacht the Hex-Eater and Gradiax the Steel Lord.

Peace was fleeting- the dragons left behind a divided and arrogant nation. New monstrous warlords rose up and led a century of conflict, raiding and piracy. Ancient rituals where young warriors proved adulthood through battle and slaughter intensified and spread.

Intent on breaking the cycles of violence, the orc warlod [Vairday Bruse](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Bruse%20Le%20Roye) united the races of Ber in 460 AOV with the assistance of a band of heroes from each race. He ended slavery and sought [Danor](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Danor)an help in writing a national constitution and [Crisillyir](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Crisillyir)i aid in reforming the legal system and bureaucracy. He opened Ber to foreign business, and encouraged industrialisation, to give his victorious soldiers jobs.

Under Vairday Bruse, a cultural revolution occurred, culminating in the emergence of the [Panoply](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Panoply) philosophy.

Vairday Bruse died in 495 AOV, passing his crown peacefully to Shantus, who took the title of Bruse.

In 500 AOV, Ber is still awash with revolutionary triumph. The [Executores Dola Liberta](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Executores%20Dola%20Liberta) travel the nation, punishing bullies and would-be tyrants. Railroads compete to connect Ber's coasts. The Panoply is fostering a generation of cosmopolitan, outward-looking civilised monsters, tribal differences forgotten.

Several tribes remain independent, most troublesome of all the [Steel Lord](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Karch) gnolls of Karch.

**Landscape** The lands of Ber are dominated by great tropical savannas. Vast swaths of hardy, spiny, and nutritionally-rich grasses provide sustenance for the enormous herbivores and trees that dot the landscape. The bears are massive, and the sequoias are the tallest in the Waking. Ber’s wet season is shorter and less devastating than Elfaivar’s legendary monsoons, with a dry season that can easily last most of the year. Unlike most of the nation’s idea-plundering culture, Beran cuisine tends to be conservative. The dragon-tyrants decadently imported vast amounts of foreign delicacies, and most Berans choose to spite their example. Common Beran ingredients are beans, lamb, boar, rice, tomatoes, and onions, augmented with generous lashings of peppers and other spices. A common dessert is chocolate-dipped churros.

Beran cities tend toward stout, vertical buildings with prominent rooftop perches. Dragons no longer alight these roofs, but they have become part of Ber’s romantic conception of its own identity. Many festivals are celebrated on these old draconic perches, and many inventors from Crisillyir come to Ber to study winged flight and test glider designs. Window cleaners can commonly be seen swinging from colorful ropes tethered to high rooftops, singing of lovers meeting to watch the sunset from the top of the city.

In the countryside, the dragon kings left an even more obvious mark: megafauna. Beasts of great hunger and great size, dragons protected herds of elephants, massive cattle, and deer as large as houses, forbidding their enslaved mortals from hunting the creatures. Huge swaths of Ber are still relatively uninhabited because these megafauna and the giant bears and tigers that hunt them pose too great a threat for cities to endure. Even more deadly are the pets that were bred for the dragon tyrants: giant bipedal reptiles known as tyrannosaurs.

Some ranches have managed to domesticate megafauna, which can feed a whole village for days. Wealthy foreigners pay huge amounts for the privilege of serving such a beast at their banquets.
