## Backstory
My name is Runar Halvorson. I was born in the [[Ulfen]] settlement [Ullerskad](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ullerskad). My father's name was Halvor and my mother's name was Ingrit. My father has a younger brother named [[Bjorn]], He is only a few years older than I am. My father was the Jarl of our clan. He was a great warrior and he taught me how to hunt, survive in the wilderness, and how to defend myself. My uncle helped train me to become a stronger warrior. My mother was a Skald and she taught me how to read and write and the love for a good saga. She taught me poetry and art. I like to keep a journal and sketch out the people and places I see. I hope to one day write a Saga like the heroes of old. We honored Desna, Erastil, Gorum, and Torag

My clan traveled a lot and I got to visit many cities along the Varisian Sea. We mostly dealt with tradesman in the many of the ports. I learned everything there was to be a sailor and working upon a ship. Our home town was Skjoldmur, a small town in the south of the island of Aegos, the larger island comprising Broken Bay in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.

Eight years ago, whole home in Skjoldmur, we were raided in the middle of the night. Chelaxian and their demonic pets. I was in our long house when they broke down our door and attacked my father. It was then while my father's back was turned and his attention on his for, my uncle stabbed him in the back. I don't remember much of what happened next. I picked up my father's Earthbreaker, killed the intruder, then attacked my uncle. He was much too strong strong for me. He used magic! I never knew he could. I have fostered a dislike for magic ever since. Before he could hurt me, my mother stepped in the way. She told me to run. I ran. I never knew what happened to my mother after that.

I hid and a few days later I stowed away on a merchant ship. They nearly through me overboard when they discovered me, but I told them I could prove my worth. I sailed with them for almost 2 years before the captain sold his ship to someone in [[Magnimar]]. I got a job on the docks. I would continue my work there for another 3 years but no one would hire an Ulfen for their ships. Longing for something more I joined the gladiator battles of Serpents Run. 

Stil feeling unfulfilled, I joined up with the local [[Pathfinder Society]] so I can go on adventures and see the world. I've held a dream since I was a child that I would take part and write my own saga.
