## History
Mayor: [[Reed MacBannin]]

A small spur of the mountains of the [[Cloudwood]] that cuts into the heart of [Flint](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Flint), the Nettles are dominated by [Cauldron Hill](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Cauldron%20Hill). The hills of the Nettles, and even the base of Cauldron Hill, are thick with slum housing as [[Risur]](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Risur)i flock to Flint in search of work. The broad switchbacks of the highway over Humble Hill are cluttered with shacks, often with two or three families sharing the same building. Poorly crafted houses cling to the sides of slopes, and they have become a nightmare for local police to patrol, giving a whole new connotation to the name “The Nettles.”

The current district mayor [[Reed Macbannin]] has been unable to halt the new arrivals, and he hasn’t been helped by the common prejudice that the factory workers are prone to crime, laziness, and general mayhem. Despite this, he has managed to earn passing respect from the people of his district; few are trusted with the stewardship of Cauldron Hill, and he has leveraged his office to get city tax money for the poorest of the poor.
