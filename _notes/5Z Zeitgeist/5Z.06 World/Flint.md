**History**

Originally established as a humbly-fortified fishing, farming, mining and shipping port during the time of [King Dukain](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#King%20Dukain), long before the [Great Malice](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Great%20Malice), few thought it would rise to its current size. The [Witches](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Witches) of [Cauldron Hill](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Cauldron%20Hill) harassed the city greatly until their defeat in 400 AOV. In 460 AOV, [King Aodhan](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#King%20Aodhan) declared that Flint would become the modernized engine that would propel Risur to equal [Danor](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Danor).

**Traveling Between Districts**

Flint is a sprawling city, and often the party’s investigations will take them across it and back in the course of a single day. In general, by making use of carriages it takes a half hour to move from the heart of one district to the heart of an adjacent one. Walking can double this time. Crossing Flint harbor or reaching one of The Ayres is usually an hourlong affair by sailboat, or half an hour if you know a friendly steamboat captain. Moving through the maze of rookeries in the Nettles can take hours, and it’s always faster to just go around than go over. Few paved roads lead to the Cloudwood, which makes carriages unsuitable, and one could spend hours or days roaming the mountains to the east or bayous to the west.

The few completed subrail stations in Central District do provide fairly swift transport, on par with carriages while being cheaper and able to carry more people. Once the full subrail network is completed, it should be possible to move between Central and either Bosum Strand or Stray River in as few as ten minutes. And if ever the route under the Nettles can overcome sabotage, it could shave nearly an hour off the time to go around the troublesome hills.

**Industrial Action**

Tensions in Flint are simmering between the industrialists and the workers. Angry over poor pay, housing and working conditions, protests and even riots are infrequent but regular occurrences. The [Docker](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Docker)s trumpet the problems of the workers. [Thames Grimsley](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/544671481393840129/932249250107125860/Thames_Grimsley.jpg) is a prominent advocate for workers' rights.

**The Navras Opera House**

Flint’s oldest surviving building is the Navras Opera House in the central district. Navras, an eladrin who fled Elfaivar after the Great Malice, designed the opera house and laid the cornerstone with a brick he had brought from his homeland. He spent nearly two hundred years personally overseeing its construction, and was aided by no less than eight Risuri kings. Then he completed the building, incongruously huge for what was at the time just a small river fort city, Navras gave the first performance by singing the dirge of [Vekesh](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Vekeshi).

The acoustic design of the performance hall somehow captures magical power from song, or from the emotional reactions of the audience. Impresarios who coordinate performance almost always hire spellcasting bards to harness this energy and craft a magic item as a memento of the show. In the three hundred years since the Navras Opera House opened, most of these items have found their ways into private collections, but a rare few have become famous, such as the Hurricane Violin, which commemorated the Fable of Seaquen and later banished a sea monster that threatened Flint Harbor in 417 AOV.
