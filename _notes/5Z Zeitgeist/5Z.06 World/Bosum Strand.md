## History
Mayor: Griffin Stowe.

The Bosum Strand docks along the east shore of Flint Bay are the heart of the city’s trade, culture, and crime.

Hundreds of warehouses serve Flint’s merchant fleet, and dozens of bars, taverns, gambling houses, and brothels serve its dock workers. Craftsmen, artists, and money changers own shops surrounding several scattered public squares throughout the district, and the district’s mayor has strong-armed property owners along major streets to ensure that when the wealthy and influential travel the strand they are not forced to see any of the district’s uncouth underbelly. This is why, of course, the [[Dockers]] make a point to perform on as many street corners and squares as possible.

Bosum Strand is unpredictably host to [The Night of the Mirror Moon](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#The%20Night%20of%20the%20Mirror%20Moon).
