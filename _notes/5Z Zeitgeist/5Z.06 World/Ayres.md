## History
North of the city lie a clear island chain and several satellite islands. Many of these are merely rocky sandbars with a few trees, but a few larger islands serve as remote villas for the city’s wealthiest. Nobles hold many family estates here, though one island is owned by a man new to his money: Guy Goodson, who swindled his initial wealth from a dozen naïve villages, and invested early in Flint’s industrial boom. Today he owns dozens of factories in [[Parity Lake]], and regularly dines with his noble neighbors, who delight in the small steamboat he uses to visit them. Since technically the Ayres are considered part of [North Shore](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#North%20Shore), it does not have its own district mayor. In practice, law and government officials never bothers the nobles on their islands unless an equally wealthy or powerful individual lodges a complaint.
