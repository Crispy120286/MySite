# R.H.C.

### Description
RHC constables are law enforcement officers tasked with protecting [[Risur]] from serious threats, usually in the form of foreign plots, magically equipped criminals, and various supernatural foes everyday police are not capable of handling. The Royal Homeland Constabulary is also includes Risur's foreign intelligence service.

Constables are invested with the authority of the king, and so are granted great leeway in their pursuit of justice and safety. While normal police must acquire warrants before they can search a building, RHC constables are trusted to not abuse their authority, and so can act as swiftly as needed. However, they are required to fill out proper paperwork and give testimony justifying their actions. A constable who uses his power for personal gain—or to harass anyone having political clout without a very good reason indeed—will find himself penalized, demoted, and possibly even imprisoned.

**Recruitment**

The RHC recruits from police, military, universities, and many other sources of talent, occasionally even accepting foreign applicants. In addition to requiring extensive background checks, recruits must undergo a magical inquisition. The king grants each branch’s local director the ability to test the loyalty of all who would apply to join the constabulary.

A candidate who agrees to undertake the test opens their mind so the director may sense their true intentions. If they have any ill will to Risur, its people, or its leaders, it will be revealed. More importantly, the candidate must show a devotion to protecting Risur. Risur need not be the primary concern of the applicant—people are expected, after all, to value their family, friends, even careers—but this precaution has kept the RHC from ever having produced a traitor in the thirty years it has been active.

**Leaders**

[Viscount Inspector Nigel Price-Hill](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/544671481393840129/932249225750781952/Lord_Nigel_Price-Hill.png) is the national director of the RHC.

The Flint branch is run by [Lady Inspectress Margaret Saxby](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Lady%20Inspectress%20Margaret%20Saxby).

She delegates the task of overseeing investigations to Assistant Chief Inspector [[Stover Delft]](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Assistant%20Chief%20Inspector%20Stover%20Delft).

Other Flinter constables include:

-   Carlao, a human veteran of the Fourth Yerasol War who proudly wears his plate armor even in the city. He’s something of a director’s pet, and acts as Saxby’s trusted aide.
-   Serena, a human tinkerer who often crafts gadgets useful for spying and “wet works,” but is surprisingly cheery, seeing all female constables as her sisters.
-   Kaea, an eladrin evoker widely distrusted by the local fey and druids after she went undercover among the skyseers to expose a vekeshi murderer.
-   Dima, a dwarf priest with an unhealthy fondness for paperwork. * Josiah, a human sniper constantly fiddling with his rifle when he’s not on mission seducing people of interest.
-   Gaethan, a half-elf ranger whose ability to speak with the dead has made him a bit addled and unreliable, having to carry a notebook to remind himself of his daily affairs.

**Ships of the RHC**

The Flint branch has five vessels at its disposal, since sometimes the constabulary needs to deal with threats at sea or simply pursue investigations in other cities or countries. Usually, though, these ships stay docked, with only maintenance crews aboard.
