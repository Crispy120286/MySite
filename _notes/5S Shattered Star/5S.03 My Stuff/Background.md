Siblings. 2 Siblings.
Biological Younger Sister
Biological Older Brother

#### Circumstances of Birth. 
89–90	Dishonored Family	You were born into a family that once was honored among your society but has since fallen into disgrace.

# Talk on Steam with Tony
Father was chief
Uncle is father's younger brother
Uncle betrayed and killed father
Uncle now chief
I challenged him to combat and lost
Uncle defeats and banishes me


Eight years ago the Linnorm King took 15 longboats to raid a city and break a cheliax blockade and sold all the treasure in Amsalom. (thats canon).
Each longboat was its own Clan under the Linnorm King's rule. (not canon)
My family was one of those such clans. My father was chief. his younger brother was jealous and killed him while on this raid. claimed he died in battle. in reality it was trechery. Uncle is now chief.
They came back and my uncle proclaimed himself chief. I overheard him talking to someone bragging how he was the one who did it. my character flew into a rage and grabbed a knife and attacked him, stabbing him in his shoulder.
I was exiled for attaching the chief "unprovoked".
being dishonored was worse than death. I was cast out of my clan. I took my fathers old Earthbreaker and sailed on merchant ships until making my way to Magnimar where i worked the docks for some time. I also took part in the gladiator battles in Serpents Run.
still feeling unfulfilled, i joined the Pathfinder Society so i can join on some adventures.
my epic wasnt going to write itseld sitting in the docks or the safe cushy gladiator battles that arent even deadly with their dull weapons
:D
Thats basically it. nice and simple.

Where were you born? Who looked after you(name/place/incident)? How do you feel about it?
>I was born in the Ulfen city of [Ullerskad](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ullerskad). My father's name is Halvor and my mother's name is Ingrit. My father has a younger brother named Bjorn, He is only a few years older than I am. My clan traveled a lot and I got to visit many cities along the Varisian Sea. One day we were attacked by a rival clan and my uncle and I managed to survive and escape on our own. I watched my father be killed right in front of me. I took his Earthbreaker and we ran. We sailed to the city of Magnimar. I had a friend named Svalk and we explored everywhere we could together, I have not seen him since the attack.

How were you educated?
>My father taught me how to hunt and survive in the wilderness, and how to defend myself. I remember we went on a week long hunting trip once and I managed to shoot my first deer. My uncle helped train me to become a stronger warrior and trained with me, He still does to this day. My mother taught me poetry and art. I like to keep a journal and sketch out the people and places I see. I hope to one day write an epic like the heroes of old.

What was your first job?
> I worked the docks in the Bazaar of Sails in Magnimar. I hated working in the docks and it was incredibly boring. My uncle didn't seem to mind it though. He seemed to be made to be a dockmaster. I participated in the mock-gladiatorial battled in Serpents Run. My life felt unfulfilled. I decided to join the Pathfinder Society. Seeking greater thrills and tests of my abilities.

Why did you become an adventurer?
>reasons.

# Some notes
Many Ulfen Guardsmen are known to retire to the town of Ullerskad in the Thanelands in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, a site dedicated to the god Gorum.

White Estrid is the current king (the term is used for both genders in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings) of the city of Halgrim. An albino with white hair and pale blue eyes, she is a fierce warrior known for conducting daring raids. She gained much notoriety and renown in 4704 AR (8 years ago) when she led a daring raid of 15 longships on the Nidalese port of Nisroch,[1] then broke a Chelaxian blockade at the Arch of Aroden and triumphantly pulled into port at Absalom to sell her treasure.[2][3]
