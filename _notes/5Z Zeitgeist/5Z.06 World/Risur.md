## Risur
Every Risuri child knows that before [[King Kelland]], no human nation had ever endured more than a few years in Lanjyr. The mighty nature spirits known today as the fey titans only allowed the elves to walk their domain, and they terrorized all others with beasts and storms and blight. But in 1200 B.O.V. (Before Our Victory), Kelland subdued the lord spirits of field and forest, of marsh and mountain. With their grudging blessings he established Risur. 

The people of Risur offered the spirits tithing and tribute, and eventually lulled them to sleep. What were once uncharted wilds of fierce beasts and tiny enclaves of elves became a prosperous civilization of men. In the seventeen centuries since, Risur’s rites of rulership have ensured that Kelland’s crown only passes to those mighty enough to cow the land’s primal spirits should they ever seek to reclaim their domain.

### Land and Culture
Risur is a subtropical country, possessed of vast forests and fertile fields fed by hundreds of rivers and streams which flow from the southern Anthras mountains to the northern shore of the Avery Sea. Temperatures are warm but comfortable year-round, though a rainy season strikes near the end of what the northern nations consider summer.

Even the poorest Risuri can enjoy fresh fruit year-round. Wealthy foreigners cherish Risur’s pineapples, limes, bananas, and massive jackfruit, but most prized are its cocoa and sugarcane, and alcohols made of each. A typical Risuri meal consists mostly of fruit, beans, bread, and fish, with the occasional beef or pork. Factory workers in Flint seldom can afford quality meat, and instead make savory stews by soaking bones and sausages in dark beans. Holiday celebrations often include steaming milk flavored with either chocolate or honey.

#### Terrain
Four main landscapes make up Risur. The northern Avery Coast is dominated by a mix of wooded beaches—where mountainous granite domes rise out of the sea and anchor dry lands—and forested swamps, often referred to by the native Elven word *bayou*—where the country’s many rivers sweep soil out into broad floodlands.

The Weftlands of Risur are low plains covering most of the western two-thirds of the country, which draw their name from the countless rivers that weave toward the sea like yarn in a cloth. Most towns and farms lie here, though pockets of wild forests and rocky hills create uninhabitable divides between provinces.

The land rises to the south, and in the mid-altitude hills an unusual swamp wriggles across the landscape, known as the High Bayou. Though the hills are uneven, huge numbers of nesting beasts and giant insects have dammed swaths of the land, slowing the rivers that flow out of the mountains and ensuring a steady source for rivers year-round. Few Risuri live here aside from villages of elves who never integrated with the rest of the nation.

Beyond the High Bayou, the rain-carved Anthras Mountains forms a broad border with Ber. Forests cover most of these mountains, though mining in the east has stripped many peaks. Centuries of attacks from Ber have kept many towns from flourishing here, but numerous old forts dot the King’s Road, which runs from the richest mining lands, all the way north to the capital.

#### Flint
The industrial powerhouse of [[Flint]] sits nestled among dozens of granite peaks along the eastern stretch of Avery Coast. With a rapidly-growing population of over half a million, slums for factory workers have begun to clump along these steep hills, while builders work to clear large sections of rainforest from within the city limits. Small satellite towns cling to the islands outside Flint’s harbor, and many foreign nations and businesses have flocked to the city to gain influence in the past forty years.

The party is based out of the [[Royal Homeland Constabulary]] branch in Flint. Extensive details on the city are presented in The City of Flint.

# **History**

Prior to its founding, Risur was dominated by the [Fey Titans](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Fey%20Titans). They roamed and rampaged freely, sparing only their [Fey](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Risuri%20Fey) servants and elven worshippers. Human settlements were sparse and often destroyed. In 1200 BOV, King Kellend subdued the Titans and struck a new bargain- humans would offer tribute to the Titans through the fey, and the Titans would slumber forevermore. Risur would be the first human settlement in [The Waking](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#The%20Waking).

Risur formalized the [Old Faith](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Old%20Faith) and struck accords with [The Dreaming](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#The%20Dreaming), providing offerings to the fey in return for their magical boons. Risuri [Skyseer](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Skyseer) druids predicted the future and guided the nation to prosperity. Risuri monarchs halted the southern advance of the [Demonocracy](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Demonocracy), led the hunt of the [Dragon Tyrants](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Dragon%20Tyrants) to end their constant invasion attempts, cast down the [Witches](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Witches) and created a House of Nobles from their descendants. Risur settled rich colonies in the [Yerasol Archipelago](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Yerasol%20Archipelago) and [Elfaivar](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Elfaivar).

Through the [Yerasol Wars](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Yerasol%20Wars), [Danor](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Danor) contested Risur's control of the archipelago with its new industrial revolution. [King Aodhan](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#King%20Aodhan) led the effort to import, copy and steal Danoran industry, bolstered by the shame of the defeat of the Fourth Yearsol War. Noble resistance led him to name [Flint](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Flint) as the Risur's new industrial capital, transforming placid fishing shacks into smog-belching factories under the stewardship of [Governor Stanfield](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Roland%20Stanfield). Risuri artisans are beginning to mesh magic and technology in a way that cursed Danor cannot. The new technology has come at a cost to Risur's relations with the fey, who are repelled from the new railroads and factories by the [tech sickness](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Cauldron%20Curse).

In 500 AOV the nation is at a turning point, with the drive to reclaim the Archipelago clashing with voices urging appeasement of Danor. The [Coaltongue](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Coaltongue), Risur's first iron battleship, will launch on 1 Spring from Flint. The King is said to be planning a grand announcement.

# **Government**

Risur is ruled by a monarch, who passes down their crown to a non-blood related successor according to the [Rites of Rulership](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Rites%20of%20Rulership), and wields legislative and executive power.

The House of Nobles consists of all province governors and all nobles with a land-owning title, and can veto the monarch's decrees with a supermajority. The 23 governorships tend to pass down family lines, and land-owning titles are typically given by the monarch to relatives of former monarchs and exceptional individuals.

A well-established bureaucracy assists the monarch with the affairs of the nation. An independent court system in the model of [Pala](https://zeitgeist-age-of-enlightenment.tiddlyhost.com/#Pala) validates the laws against a national constitution.

# **Landscape**

Risur is a subtropical country, possessed of vast forests and fertile fields, fed by hundreds of rivers and streams; they flow from the southern Anthras Mountains to the northern shore of the Avery Sea. Temperatures are warm but comfortable year-round, though a rainy season strikes near the end of what the northern nations consider summer. Even the poorest Risuri can enjoy fresh fruit year-round. Wealthy foreigners cherish Risur’s pineapples, limes, bananas, and massive jackfruit, but most prized are its cocoa and sugarcane, and alcohols made of each. A typical Risuri meal consists mostly of fruit, beans, bread, and fish, with occasional beef or pork. Manufactory workers in Flint seldom can afford quality meat, and instead make savory stews by soaking bones and sausages in dark beans. Holiday celebrations often include steaming milk flavored with either chocolate or honey.

Five main landscapes comprise Risur.

-   The northern Avery Coast is dominated by a mix of wooded beaches, where mountainous granite domes rise out of the sea and anchor dry lands; and forested swamps, often referred to by the native Elvish word ‘bayou,’ where the country’s many rivers sweep soil out into broad floodlands.
-   The Weftlands of Risur are low plains covering most of the western two-thirds of the country, drawing their name from the countless rivers that weave toward the sea like yarn in a cloth. Most towns and plant-growth-supplemented farms lie here, though pockets of wild forests and rocky hills create uninhabitable divides between provinces.
-   The land rises to the south, and in the mid-altitude hills, an unusual swamp wriggles across the landscape, known as the High Bayou. Though the hills are uneven, huge numbers of nesting beasts and giant insects have dammed swaths of the land, slowing the rivers that flow out of the mountains and ensuring a steady source for rivers year-round. Few Risuri live here aside from villages of elves who never integrated with the rest of the nation.
-   Beyond the High Bayou, the rain-carved Anthras Mountains forms a broad border with Ber. Forests cover most of these mountains, though mining in the east has stripped many peaks. Many decades ago, repeated attacks from Ber kept many towns from flourishing, and numerous old forts dot the King’s Road, which runs from the richest mining lands and all the way north to the capital.
-   The Antwalk Thicket is a great expanse of finely cultivated forest-gardens southeast of Slate.
